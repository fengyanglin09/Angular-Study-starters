### Using the Signal-based approach instead of decorators offers some additional advantages:


You can make the query results more predictable.

All Signal-based queries return a Signal and when there are multiple values, the Signals returns a regular array. The decorators return a variety of return types and when your query returns multiple values, they return a query list instead of a regular array.

Signal-based queries can be used for HTML elements that change over time because they are rendered conditionally or outputted in a for loop. The directive approach has issues with both scenarios and doesnâ€™t automatically notify you when the template is updated.

TypeScript can automatically infer the type of the queried HTML element or component.
