As you can see, you can make the input required and provide the Signal input with a configuration object to give it an alias and transform function. The Signal input uses a simpler syntax, helps improve the change detection mechanism, and allows you to remove the ngOnChanges life cycle hook.

When you combine the Signal input with computed Signals, you can remove the ngOnChanges life cycle hook because all properties that need to be updated upon the input of a specific property can now automatically be updated by using a computed Signal based on the input Signal. Any additional logic you want to run can be declared inside a Signal effect that reacts to the Signal input.
