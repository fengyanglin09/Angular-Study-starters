The run() function is defined inside runOutsideAngular() to re-enter the Angular zone after performing a task outside of it. This is useful for running code that should trigger Angular's change detection after completing a heavy task that was executed outside the Angular zone to avoid unnecessary change detection cycles.  Here's a brief explanation of the code:  

runOutsideAngular(): Executes the provided function outside of Angular's zone, preventing Angular's change detection from running.

run(): Re-enters Angular's zone, allowing Angular's change detection to run for the code inside this function.

This pattern is used to optimize performance by minimizing the number of change detection cycles triggered by heavy tasks.
